            <p>In July of 1998, a series of cannibalistic murders began taking place in Raccoon City, USA. After tracking down the source of the murders, Raccon City's police department sent their elite task force know as S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics and Rescue Service) to the Arklay mountains to investigate. The S.T.A.R.S Bravo team was deployed - but contact was lost soon after their arrival. Alpha Team was then deployed to assess the situation and was determined to continue the investigation.</p>
